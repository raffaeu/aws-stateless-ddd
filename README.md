# AWS Stateless Domain Driven Design

Welcome to the AWS Stateless Domain Driven Design project repository. In this space you can find a fully working example of how to implement a `Domain Driven Design` architecture using stateless services from Amazon Web Services.

In this page you can find an introduction on the topic and instructions on how to access the code, deploy it on AWS Account and run the demo application.

 > The article is trying to put into context the stateless DDD topic, explained by [AWS Documentation here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/modernization-decomposing-monoliths/decompose-subdomain.html).

## Micro-service decomposition

The first topic to be discussed is the _decomposition_ of a Domain, which is the key to be able to breakdown a large monolith application into `stateless` and `serverless` technology.
